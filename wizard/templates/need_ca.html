      <p>Secured communications will require certificates and keys. For example
      the LDAP server (which is the only container that is mandatory)
      will require one.</p>

      <p>Here you will have two alternatives:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>If you are testing this software or do not care about warnings
              about self-signed certificates, you will create your own
              Certificate Authority. Check the instructions below.</li>
          <li>You can use certificates from a recognized certificate authority.
          This is a longer process that might cost money. Check, for example:
          <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's encrypt</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      {% if run > 0 %}
      <div class="alert alert-danger">XXX</div>
      {% endif %}
      In order for this process to conclude
        you need to either:
        <ul>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
        <ul>
